<h2>Wow! What's that?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A presentation system.</li>
<li>Kinda LibreOffice Impress or PowerPoint, but online with CSS3 transforms!</li>
<li>An entry for the Dev Derby Contest.</li>
</ul>
By now, use mouse gestures or the keyboard to move. We'll learn more about that.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<b>To navigate:</b> You can use either:
<ul><li>mouse gestures, clicking and "dragging". Just like you'd do with a real cube.</li><li>The keyboard arrows.</li></ul>
<b>To create it:</b> That's in another slide, sorry.

<h2>I just spotted a bug!</h2>
This is free software, be bold! You can try to fix it, and send me a patch (if you want) or fill an issue at github (see below). At least on my Firefox, it is a little slow; in Chrome it's smoother. Not my fault, maybe this is a thing of the old computer I'm writing from.

<h2>What's that color?</h2>
Slashdot green. The bottom part of the article gradient.
<h2>How is it called?</h2>
Hmm I don't know. Maybe <i>Slicube</i>? Slide-cube.

<h2>The Slicube Format</h2>
<h3>Or how to create other slideshows like this one.</h3>
<ul>
<li>XML-based.</li>
<li>Four tags: presentation, cube, name, and face.</li>
</ul>

</face>
<face><![CDATA[
<h2>The opening tag</h2>
Simply <tt>presentation</tt>. It opens and closes the document. Easy, huh?
]]>
</face>
<face><![CDATA[
<h2>The cube tag</h2>
One for each cube. As easy as <tt>cube</tt>, with a child <tt>name</tt> with the name of that cube, and with six children <tt>face</tt> which represent each face.
<p><b>Tip:</b> To know the order of the face tags, the best way is "trial-and-error".</p>

<face><![CDATA[
<h2>What's in the face?</h2>
Plain HTML. It's better when enclosed inside CDATA.

<h2>Only standards</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML(5)</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li><b>CSS3:</b> animations, transitions, and CSS transforms.</li>
</ul>

<face><![CDATA[
<h2>The HTML5 part</h2>
The main difference, which allows it to be HTML5, is the fact that it has a <tt>doctype html</tt> tag. No canvas, or HTML5-specific tags (as far as I know).

<face><![CDATA[
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
Used to handle user interaction, basically. It parses the XML document, renders it, etc.
]]>
</face>
<face><![CDATA[
<h2>CSS3</h2>
To create the cubes (via 3D transforms), the <del>fancy</del> could-be-improved grid showing the slides, and style the document. Also, for the smooth transitions.
